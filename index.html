            <h2>What is the Abuse Driven Development Manifesto?</h2>
            <p>
                The Scrum Manifesto, the eXtreme programming and test-driven development (TDD) are all examples of agile methodologies. All of the metodologies mentioned can be customized to fit your developer team, but there is one thing missing in those methodologies and that is the focus on cyber security and writting secure code. Regardless of methodology choosen the following manifesto should be considered as a suplement and adjusted to fit with your team.
            </p>
            <h2>What is secure code?</h2>
            <p>
                Secure code is the result of secure programming, which in turn means written code that activly tries to prevent vulnerabilties
            </p>
            <h2>Why write secure code?</h2>
            <p>
                Financial, medical and other sensitive data is being prossessed in the software the developers create and it is therefor crucial that those solutions are secured properly.
            </p>
            <h2>How should I use this manifesto?</h2>
            <p>
                Use this Manifesto as a supplement to your current methodology with the goal of developing more secure applications and systems. That in turn protects developers, customers and users from abuse. This Manifesto is not a 'how to'-guide on writing secure code, but it is an idea of how cyber security can become a part of every software developing teams daily focus.

                    <li>Use cheetsheets to help your team secure the software</li>
                    <li>Never trust external data, handle it properly</li>
